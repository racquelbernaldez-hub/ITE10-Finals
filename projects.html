            This project showcases my laboratory activity where I performed a microscopic examination.
            It demonstrates accuracy, focus, and scientific curiosity.

        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p>
            This photo was taken during our Grade 12 final exam—a moving exam focused on laboratory equipment. We only had 10 seconds to answer each question, so everyone was really pressured and focused. You can see me (marked in the picture) carefully writing my answers while moving from one station to another.

<br>
It was one of the most challenging parts of our laboratory class, but it also taught us discipline, quick thinking, and how to stay calm under pressure. Even though it was difficult, the experience was memorable and helped prepare us for real laboratory work in the future.
